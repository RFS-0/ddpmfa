	<h1 id="project">Project</h1>
		<p>A <a href="{% url 'dpmfa:project-list' %}">project</a> is a container where you can organize all information of a specific project. 
		In particluar it contains all the models of a project. Before you can create and configure a model you have to create a project</p>
	
	<h1 id="model">Model</h1>
		<p>The model is the most important entity. Once you have created a project you can create a new model. The configuration of a model is
		process that is done in three sequential steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the Model Designer to construct the material flow you are interested in</li>
			<li>Check the parametrization to validate your inputs.</li>
			<li>Create an experiment to run the model configuration</li>
		</ol> 
		<p>You can of course iterate over this steps as many times as you want.</p>
		<p>The model itself is actually a template for your experiments. This allows you to rearrange the entities your model consists of.
		Each time you create a new experiment the current current state of the model designer and all the parameters of the model will be copied
		and attached to the experiment. It is important to notice that copy created for the experiment is read only. This ensures that the results
		of an experiment will always correspond to its design and parameters.</p>
		<p>For more details have a look at the description of <a>experiment</a></p>
	
	<h1 id="model-designer">Model designer</h1>
		<p>The model designer is where you can design your model. Here you can add entities and link them with the various kinds of transfers</p>
		<p>In particluar you can add the following entites to create you material flow model:</p>
		<p>Inflows to the system:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>External list inflow</li>
				<li>External function inflow</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Compartments of the system:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sink</li>
				<li>Flow Compartment</li>
				<li>Stock</li>
			</ul>
		<p>You can link those entites with these kinds of transfers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Constant transfer</li>
				<li>Random choice transfer</li>
				<li>Stochastic transfer</li>
				<li>Aggregated transfer</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If you are familiar with UML class diagrams, the you might find the following diagram helpful as an overview:</p>

	<h1 id="external-inflows">External inflows</h1>
	
		<p>External inflows are used to model inflow of material into the system. Ther are two distinct types of external inflows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>External list inflows</li>
			<li>External function inflows</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="external-list-inflow">External list inflow</h2>
			<p>The external list inflow lets you configure a sinlge period inflow for each period of your simulation. Each single period
			inflow can be one of the following three types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed value inflow</li>
				<li>Stochastic inflow</li>
				<li>Random choice inflow</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In particular you can edit the following parameters for each external list inflow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Target</li>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Start delay</li>
				<li>Derivation distribution</li>
				<li>Derivation parameters</li>
				<li>Derivation factor</li>
				<li>Single periods inflows</li>
			</ul> 
			
			<h3 id="eli-target">Target</h3>
				<p>The target represents the compartment (i.e. Flow compartment, sink or stock) the material flows to. You can specify
				only one targe for each external list inflow. Please refer to the quick reference to see how you can specify a target.</p>
			
			<h3 id="eli-name">Name</h3>
				<p>The name of the external list inflow.</p>
				
			<h3 id="eli-start-delay">Start delay</h3>
				<p>The delay indicates after how many periods of you simulation the external list inflow will start to transfer material. E.g.
				if your simulation has 10 periods and you configure the start delay to 3, the external list inflow will transfer material
				from period 3 up to period 10.</p>
			
			<h3 id="eli-derivation-distribution">Derivation distribution</h3>
				<p>The derivation distribution is optional.</p>
				<p>If a derivation distribution is definted, it is used to sample a derivation factor which in turn is used to determine
				the derivation factor in each period. The derivation factor is then multiplied by the value the single period inflow of
				the current period.</p>
				
			<h3 id="eli-derivation-parameters">Derivation parameters</h3>
				<p>The derivation parameters are the argument used by the derivation distribution function to determine the derivation factor.</p>
			
			<h3 id="eli-derivation-factor">Derivation factor</h3>
				<p>The derivation factor is used to adjust the material inflow in each period i.e. the inflow value of each period
				is multiplied by the derivation factor which is being sampled for each period.
				
			<h3 id="eli-single-period-inflows">Sinlge period inflows</h3>
				<p>A single period inflow represents the material inflow for a given period. This means that in an external list inflow you have to 
				specify one sinlge period inflow for each period.</p>
				<p>Each single period inflow can be of one of three types:
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed value inflow</li>
						<li>Stochastic inflow</li>
						<li>Random choice inflow</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Please refert to single period inflow for more details.</p>
				
		<h2 id="external-function-inflow">External function inflow</h2>
			<p>The external function inflow lets you define the inflow to the system as a function. For this you have to provide a basic inflow i.e.
			one of the types of sinlge period inlfows or a number (which then will be converted to a single period inflow).
			<p>In particular you can edit the following parameters for each external list inflow:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Target</li>
					<li>Basic inflow</li>
					<li>Inflow function</li>
					<li>Derivation distribution</li>
					<li>Derivation parameters</li>
					<li>Start delay</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h3 id="efi-target">Target</h3>
				<p>The target represents the compartment (i.e. Flow compartment, sink or stock) the material flows to. You can specify
				only one targe for each external list inflow. Please refer to the quick reference to see how you can specify a target.</p>
			
			<h3 id="efi-basic-inflow">Basic inflow</h3>
				<p>The basic inflow represents the initial inflow to the system. It is only used in the first period of the simualton. 
				The inflow function uses this inflow to calculate the base value that is then used as an input to the inflow function. 
				It can be either one of the three single period inflow types (i.e. fixed value, stochastic, random choice) or a number
				that represents the amount material	that flows into the system.</p>
					
			<h3 id="efi-inflow-function">Inflow function</h3>
				<p>returns a material amount as inflow for a specific period; gets basic value and period number as input. If no input
				function is defined, the basic value is used for all periods.
